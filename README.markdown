# Accession [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/abedra/accession.png)](http://travis-ci.org/abedra/accession?branch=master)

A Clojure library for redis (current version 0.1.1)

## Installing

Simply add Accession to your leiningen project file:

``` clojure
[accession "0.1.1"]
```

#### But i'm using clojure 1.x because it is stable. I don't want to use 1.4-alpha2!

That's ok. If you are using Clojure 1.2.1 or higher you shouldn't have any issues. You can tell leiningen not to pull 1.4.0-alpha2 into your project using the `:exclusions` feature:

``` clojure
[accession "0.1.1" :exclusions [org.clojure/clojure]]
```

## Usage
   
Accession is used just like you would use redis from the command
line. All available redis commands will be implemented. For a list
of currently implemented commands see
[core.clj](https://github.com/abedra/accession/blob/master/src/accession/core.clj). The
example below demonstrates standard usage:

``` clojure
;; Make sure to alias accession.core since several clojure.core
;; functions are replaced
(require '[accession.core :as redis])
 
;; Create a connection map
(def c (redis/connection-map {}))
 
;; Use the connection to run commands against redis
(redis/with-connection c (redis/set "foo" "some value"))
-> "OK"
(redis/with-connection c (redis/get "foo"))
-> "some value"
 
;; When you run multiple queries, accession will assume
;; pipelining. This behavior is subject to change.
(redis/with-connection c
    (redis/rpush "children" "A")
    (redis/rpush "children" "B")
    (redis/rpush "children" "C"))
-> (1 2 3)

;; You can use the Redis pub/sub features 
(def channel (redis/subscribe c {"bar" (fn [x] (prn x))}))
-> ("subscribe" "bar" 1)

;; and afterwards add more consumers to the channel
(redis/subscribe channel {"baz" #(prn %)})
-> ("subscribe" "baz" 2)

;; You can send messages like so
(redis/with-connection c (redis/publish "bar" "Hello bar") 
                         (redis/publish "baz" "Hello baz"))
-> ("message" "bar" "Hello bar")
   ("message" "baz" "Hello baz")

;; Again, this API is subject to change.
```

This library is targeted at Redis 2.0+. If you are using an older
version of Redis or are using a version of Clojure earlier than 1.3.0,
you may have better luck with
[redis-clojure](https://github.com/ragnard/redis-clojure).
