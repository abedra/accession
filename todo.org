#+TODO: TODO IN-PROGRESS REVIEW DONE
* Docs
** IN-PROGRESS Update readme for new pooled-connection API.
* Response Processing
** TODO Return proper values for ints, true, and false?
** TODO Return something better for errors?
Currently just returns an "ERR ..." string. Better to throw an exception?
Something else?
** TODO Perhaps a thin interface for prn or deep-freeze serialization?
* API
** TODO Need a way to test connections for life after entering subscription mode.
   See discussion: https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/420
   And what to do when a dropped connection is detected? Remember that
   subscriptions, etc. are attached to a specific connection - i.e. we'd need
   to re-subscribe, etc.
** TODO Create a representation of every command offered in redis.
** TODO Parsed sort command (see redis-clojure).
* Tests
** IN-PROGRESS Create a small test for each of the redis commands to demonstrate that they work as expected.
** TODO return-bytes, sort, script commands
